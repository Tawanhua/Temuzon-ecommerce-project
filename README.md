# Ecommerce Project

The frontend of the Ecommerce Application is built with React.js, providing a modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface for browsing products, managing the shopping cart, and placing orders. It interacts with the backend via RESTful API endpoints to fetch product data, handle cart operations, process orders, and track deliveries, ensuring a seamless shopping experience for users.

The backend of the Ecommerce Application is developed using Node.js and Express.js, providing a robust RESTful API for managing products, user authentication, shopping carts, and order processing. It handles business logic, data validation, and securely interacts with a database to store and retrieve ecommerce data. The backend ensures reliable communication with the frontend, enabling dynamic product listings, secure checkout, and order management functionalities.

## Project Description

The Full Stack Web Application is developed using ReactJS, ExpressJS, NodesJS, SQLite, and Sequelize. It provides a RESTful API for products, allowing users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Key Components:

* React.js: Utilized for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. React components are modular and reusable, facilitating the development of complex UI elements.

* Hooks: React Hooks such as useState and useEffect, for managing component state and lifecycle.

* Axios: A lightweight HTTP client for making asynchronous HTTP requests to the backend API endpoints. Axios simplifies data fetching and handling of responses.

* User Interface Components: HTML, CSS, and JSX are used to design and implement user interface components such as task lists, task forms, and task items. CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI may be utilized for styling and layout.

* State Management: React state is utilized to manage the application's state, including task data and user input. State changes trigger re-rendering of components, ensuring a responsive user experience.

* Client-Side Routing: React Router can be integrated for client-side routing, enabling navigation between different views within the application without full-page reloads.
